## Exercise I

a) O(n)


b)O(n^4)


c)O(1^n)

## Exercise II


Set n to be a variable that represents the number of stories a building has

Set f to be the variable that an egg breaks at if dropped from

Write an equation that says if n is greaterthan or equal to f, the egg will break

So long as f is less than n, the function will have an O(n) run time as it is just checking to see if f is greater than or equal to n. 

If egg is thrown off the first floor (n = 1) the egg wouldn't break so the function would try at floor 2 (n = 2) and so on  until the egg reaches the floor where eggs go to die.
